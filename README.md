Central Purchase Order queue

Business case

Purchase orders are created from requisitioning users from a non-central system (web application) and then orders are entered manually into Centralized ERP system to create real Purchase Order (document posted).
Now due to increased number of orders from non-central system it is required to automate the creation of the PO posting within ERP system.
Since central ERP system does not have access to distributed web app it is required to create an API app that will hold every order created from distributed system and then ERP central system will fetch those orders and will post them into the system. This interface will work as a queue between non-posted and posted documents.
Since document posting in ERP central system requires a lot of business validation and knowledge which is already built-in, makes no sense to post the documents from an external source.
